# On Air Pollution

This repository contains all the files for the project in *Mathematical Statistics*. We are currently working on it, so it is not complete and final yet.

## Structure

-   **data** contains the datasets, both in the raw and clean formats
-   **output-graphics** contains all the images (plots, graphs, etc.) used in the project
-   **src** contains the source code
